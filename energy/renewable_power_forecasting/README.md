# Renewable Power Forecasting â€“ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps for building a complete renewable energy forecasting project using open datasets from Germany, focusing on solar and wind power generation.

---

## 1. Problem Definition

- [ ] Specify the forecasting goal:
  - Forecast solar, wind, or both types of generation?
  - Forecasting horizon: short-term (e.g., next 24h), medium-term (e.g., 7 days), or long-term?
  - Point forecasts or probabilistic forecasts?

---

## 2. Data Collection and Understanding

- [ ] Download dataset from Kaggle
- [ ] Identify key files (`Germany Solar.csv`, `Germany Wind.csv`, `Germany Weather.csv`)
- [ ] Examine the data structure (columns, granularity, data types)

---

## 3. Preprocessing and Cleaning

- [ ] Convert timestamps and handle time zones
- [ ] Merge datasets (e.g., solar with weather data)
- [ ] Handle missing values and inconsistencies
- [ ] Filter time periods with reliable coverage

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- [ ] Visualize time series (trends, seasonality)
- [ ] Analyze autocorrelation and lag structure
- [ ] Explore relationships with meteorological variables (temperature, wind speed, solar radiation)

---

## 5. Feature Engineering

- [ ] Create time-based features (hour, day of week, month)
- [ ] Add lags and rolling statistics
- [ ] Include weather variables as predictors
- [ ] Normalize or standardize features if needed

---

## 6. Modeling

- [ ] Build a baseline model (e.g., naive, moving average)
- [ ] Evaluate classical models:
  - ARIMA/SARIMA
  - Regression with lagged variables
  - Random Forest / XGBoost
- [ ] Experiment with deep learning models (optional):
  - LSTM / GRU
  - Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)

---

## 7. Validation and Metrics

- [ ] Create time-aware train/validation/test splits
- [ ] Evaluate using metrics such as:
  - MAE, RMSE, MAPE
  - CRPS (for probabilistic forecasts)
- [ ] Compare performance across models

---

## 8. Interpretation and Visualization

- [ ] Plot predictions vs actual values
- [ ] Show feature importances
- [ ] Analyze error patterns across seasons or regions

---

## 9. Deployment and Generalization

- [ ] Export the final model (joblib, pickle, etc.)
- [ ] Create a `predict()` function for future data
- [ ] (Optional) Wrap as an API or deployable pipeline

---

## 10. Final Report

- [ ] Document methodology, decisions, and results
- [ ] Generate key charts and comparison tables
- [ ] Discuss limitations and future work

---

## Extras (Optional)

- [ ] Probabilistic forecasting with quantiles or simulations
- [ ] Incremental / online training
- [ ] Interactive UI with Streamlit or Dash
