### 4. IoT + ML: Intelligent Home Event Predictor

- **Highlights**: Sensor fusion, HMMs, sequence modeling  
- **What**: Predicts user behavior from sensor data (e.g., waking, leaving)  
- **Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, possibly Pyro or TensorFlow Probability  
- **Public Value**: Open-source smart home modeling framework  

---

### 5. DriftLab: Drift Detection Playground

- **Highlights**: Data drift, model monitoring, dashboards  
- **What**: Visual simulation lab for different types of drift  
- **Stack**: Streamlit/Gradio, scikit-multiflow, sktime  
- **Public Value**: Educational and monitoring tool  

---

## üöÄ Exposure Strategy

- Clean **GitHub repos** with READMEs, tests, and example notebooks  
- **Blog posts** with explanations and math insights  
- **Demos** via YouTube or Loom  
- Talks at **meetups/conferences** (PyData, MLOps Community)  
- Use **interactive tools**: Streamlit, Gradio, or Shiny  
- Host **gallery notebooks** using public datasets or APIs

## ‚úÖ Next Step

1. Create local repo for first project  
2. Scaffold folders, initial README, and Git setup  
3. Build incrementally with versioned commits
